HealthCare Vital Record System

PROBLEM STATEMENT
          Communication between healthcare facilities, both internally and externally, and even with other stakeholders, remains difficult. This result of poor communication is frequently brought on by aging technology, silos between department, and other problems. Even the quality of patient treatment has been connected to poor internal communication. For instance imagine having to sort out through tens of thousands of data points or hundreds of pages at a time of test data to get the important information  since most patient’s data are recorded on paperwork. For hospital staff members and managers, physicians, and public health officials, these circumstances frequently occur,where patient’s data are needed which most at times the information are lost. Hence leading to poor communication between staff members,  and poor management of patient’s data


INTRODUCTION AND PROPOSED SOLUTION
             The healthcare industry requires a reliable and efficient vital record system for patients to ensure that nurses can access accurate and up-to-date information about their patients. healthcare vital record system is a medical management framewok that register and incorporates the data from every single department that is enabling hospitals to manage information and data related to aspects of healthcare

With all this problem the hospital usually faces, I decided to propose this solution where the system’s main purpose  is for managing patient’s data. This application can be very helpful to doctors as well as patients by providing better way to manage, share and store patient’s data. For instance a patient might forget some of their medication allergies, what tests they had performed, exactly what surgery was done, if this patient's data was registered and managed in this system, the system will automatically provide all records regarding he\she condition. This helps to easy management and communication between staff members, nurses 

OBJECTIVES
      The goal of the Health Care Vital Record System is to automate the current manual system with the aid of computerized tools and comprehensive computer software, meeting their needs, in order to store their important data and information for a longer period of time with simple access and manipulation.
